Web-based Intel 8080 assembler and emulator, focused on education. Made in the Spring of 2018.

I made this as a part of the Honors Program Enrichment Option at my school, which allowed me to create or contribute to a project in my field.

Since I hadn't yet had a chance to take the assembly course, I figured it would be a good opportunity to teach myself while creating an environment for others to learn in as well!

Looking back, I'd like to improve this in a few different ways (since I know a lot more about assembly in general now), so I hope I get the opportunity to work on this again in the future!
