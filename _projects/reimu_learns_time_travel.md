Video game made with Phaser.io over the course of three days in the Summer of 2018 for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/touhou-jam-2" target="_blank">2nd Touhou Fan Game Jam</a>!

This was really fun to make! For those who don't know what Touhou is, it's basically a video game where you try to dodge a bunch of oncoming bullets. For me, these games are the most stressful fun I can have, and I love them.

The theme for this game jam was "only once", and the way I decided to interpret this was I had the player only have one chance at winning. One life. The catch? They can travel back in time!

A strange gimmick that was admittedly very fun for me to implement, and even though it could have been done better, I'm still very proud of this game as a whole.

I won the ZUN award for making the game and all of the assets on my own as well! (Though I did use the Phaser.io library for low-level stuff like graphics and input... didn't write my own engine in 3 days... weak)
